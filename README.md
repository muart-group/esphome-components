# muart-group/esphome-components

### ⚠️ This repo is underconstruction for a bit as we move here from the unweildy [muart-group/esphome](https://github.com/muart-group/esphome).

Components to support Mitsubishi heat pumps in ESPHome.  Check out the documentation for more info at [muart-group.github.io](https://muart-group.github.io/).

Aspirationally, the `main` branch will contain stable code ready to be merged to ESPHome or elsewhere.  The `dev` branch will contain more actively developed code, but should still be relatively stable.

Once [this PR](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/7289) is merged, bugs can be reported in the main ESPHome issue tracking repository.  Until then, all issues may be reported here.  (Experimental feature requests or exploration may still end up living here instead of in ESPHome, but we'll have to see)
